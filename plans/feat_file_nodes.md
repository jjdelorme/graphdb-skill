# Plan: Fix Phase 1 Parity Gap - File Nodes and DEFINED_IN Edges

## Goal
Implement `File` nodes and `DEFINED_IN` edges in the Go ingestion pipeline to match the legacy implementation.

## Steps
- [x] ~~Create `File` node logic in `worker.go`~~ ✅ Implemented
- [x] ~~Create `DEFINED_IN` edge logic in `worker.go`~~ ✅ Implemented
- [x] ~~Add tests to verify `File` nodes are emitted~~ ✅ Implemented
- [x] ~~Add tests to verify `DEFINED_IN` edges are emitted~~ ✅ Implemented
